#### This repository contains prerequisite files + more to be used while modelling proteins with Modeller

- `pdb2fasta.pl`
  - a perl script to obtain a FASTA sequence for a desired protein
  - This perl script was created by Ranjit Vijayan in March 2066 (a former member of SBCB, Dept of Biochem, Uni of Oxford, and a Professor in the Dept of Biology, UAE Univ, as of Sep 2023)
  
- `model.ali`
  - an example alignment file (model.ali) to be used by Modeller

- `model.py`
  - an example python script (model.py) to be used to run Modeller

- `dope_scores.py` + `dope_scores_least.sh`
  - scripts to be used in conjunction to obtain DOPE scores of all protein models generated and determine the protein model number with least DOPE score
  - Instructions to run are provided at the end of the `model.py` script
